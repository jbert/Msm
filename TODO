- assembler...


DONE - define simple language (e.g. arithmetic s-exprs)

DONE - lex and parse language to an AST

- move some of the to_c test infrastructure into module

- define single 'run' interface, taking an engine (eval, toc, asm) to use

3 - compile AST to x64 assembler 
    DONE a - eval first
    b - then go via C 
    c - then via assembler stack everything, to avoid need for register allocator

4 - link and run
