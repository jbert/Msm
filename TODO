- make Msm/Evaluator pass $runner around and drop file-scope @BINDINGS
    - possibly use mixin with asm

- add test to check that asm doesn't leave stuff stacked up:
    (+ 1 2)
    (+ 3 4
    (+ 
        (let ((a 1)
              (b 2))
          (+ a b)
          (- a b)))
- add let support to Asm
    - each declared variable needs storage
    - need to handle shadowing of vars
        - lexical context in perl is:
            [
                { name => asm_label, name2 => asm_label2 },
                { name => asm_label3 }
            }
        - use same declare/expression model as Toc?
            - poss rename 'declare'?
        - identifier->expression chains up the lexical scopes
            - emits 1st label found
        - mixin codeshare with Eval?
            - maybe save until we have lambda
            - and Toc?
            - 'asm_label' == 'global_c_var'


- add 'emit' and nesting level for nice Toc 

- add support for programs with boolean value?
    - (eq? 1 2)
        - would need to carry expression type info through asm + toc?

- add strings
    - add '(error "string")'
    - add (if 1 1 (error "not evaluated"))
        - need nicer code to plug in ops

- add vars?
    - use let form
        - (let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b))
        - (let ((a 1) (b 2))
            (let ((a 3))
                (+ a b)))
        - attach a lexenv to each ast expression
            - let introduces new lexenv
                - otherwise use containing lexenv
            - each runner needs to chain up
                TOC: Use C nested scopes? :-)
                    - introduce named result vars for each expression
                    - then evaluate each expression in a lexical scope
                    - then allow let to introduce bindings in that scope
                Evaluator:
                    - maintain a @env = ( { a => 3, b => 2}, {b => 3} )
                    - need to push pad, pop pad at start/end of each let
                Asm:
                    - same as C?
                        - means not being stack based any more?
                            - nope, still stack based
                            - but we track lex vars into named slots
                            and know when we make a new slot (shadowing) and when we re-use
                        - alternatives?

- add cons/car/cdr?

- add lambda?

- add timing support to each backend
    - sep runtime and compile time?

- support enough scheme to write a prime sieve....
    - maybe support "DIV" prime finding first
        - make mzscheme test runner a real runner?
        - prefix with (require rnrs/base-6)
        - then can have 'mod'
    - first write a prime sieve in scheme...
    - storage?
    - recursion/looping?
    - lambda?

DONE - structure tests by language feature so can just run some
    DONE - and have 'run one' env var

- add timings/benchmarks of engines
