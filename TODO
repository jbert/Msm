- asm:
    DONE - handle -ve numbers
        - maybe just need output?
        - use decimal output
            - add sign to existing routine

DONE - add conditionals
    DONE - 0 is false in scheme
    - needs concept of true and false
        - scheme compatible
        - add literals (#t and #f)

- add equality testing
    - returns boolean
    '(if (eq? (+ 1 2) (* 1 2)) 1 2)'

- add strings
    - add '(error "string")'
    - add (if 1 1 (error "not evaluated"))
        - need nicer code to plug in ops

- move the "die unless if has 3 args" code to one place
    - Parser?
    - AST validator?
    - Common code for runner?
    - MSM::AST::IfExpression?
        - would allow easy handling of eager/lazy eval

- add vars?

- add cons/car/cdr?

- add lambda?

DONE - structure tests by language feature so can just run some
    DONE - and have 'run one' env var

- add timings/benchmarks of engines
